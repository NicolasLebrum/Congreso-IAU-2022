Optimization of the Gauss Method for Determining NEA Orbits

Ephemeris data from the JPL NASA database is used, and an optimization is applied to the Gauss method to determine the orbits of near-Earth asteroids. 
To run the code, use the Main.ipynb notebook. If you wish to make any contributions, please clone the repository.

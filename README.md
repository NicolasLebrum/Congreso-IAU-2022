**OPTIMIZATION OF THE GAUSS METHOD FOR DETERMINING NEA's ORBITS**

Ephemeris data from the JPL NASA database is used, and an optimization is applied to the Gauss method to determine the orbits of near-Earth asteroids. 
To run the code, use the Main.ipynb notebook. If you wish to make any contributions, please clone the repository.
